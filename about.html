        In the heart of Zone 1, Santiago, Bato, Camarines Sur, The Nabua Educational Learning Center emerged as a beacon of educational excellence, gracing the educational landscape from 2014 to 2017. Our school, a visionary venture, has been steadfast in its commitment to shaping young minds within the Municipality of Bato, offering not just education but an accessible gateway to quality learning.
        <br><br>
        During 2018, the school director, Mr. Louie Garry B. Taburnal, and school administrator, Mrs. Warlita C. Taburnal, decided to move to a new site at San Rafael, Bato, Camarines Sur, which offered a picturesque and expansive campus, complete with an 8-room building.

    <p>The increasing number of registrants for the school year prompted the institution to seek out larger accommodations. In 2018, the school elected, at this point, to change its name to Taburnal Learning Center Inc.</p>

        In 2020, Taburnal Learning Center Inc. took the significant step of establishing its High School Department in the heart of Bato, Camarines Sur. Since then, its enrollment has been steadily flourishing.

            For the forthcoming academic year 2023-2024, after careful foresight, the school's esteemed director and dedicated administrator jointly made the strategic decision to inaugurate the Senior High School Department within the institution's academic framework.

By offering such a diverse range of academic pathways, the institution endeavors to empower the youth with the essential skills, knowledge, and values to thrive in an ever-evolving global landscape. These strands include the disciplines of Accountancy, Business, and Management (ABM), Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS), Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), General Academic Strand (GAS), and Technical Vocational-Livelihood (TVL).
